     <div class="section-title">Overview</div>
    <p>
        This project focused on redesigning the 1,250 m² Bahen Courtyard at the
        University of Toronto St. George campus to create a sustainable,
        accessible, and multifunctional gathering space with food access.
    </p>

    <div class="section-title">Design Context</div>
    <p>
        The client for this project was the University of Toronto Sustainability
        Office. The redesign was constrained by existing infrastructure,
        including rainwater cistern towers, a water feature, and mature trees,
        all of which were required to remain in place. Additional constraints
        included weather conditions, fire safety regulations, noise limits, and
        accessibility requirements.
    </p>

    <div class="section-title">Design Process</div>
    <p>
        The team identified key stakeholders, service environment conditions, and
        detailed functions, objectives, and constraints (FOCs). A structured
        ideation process was used, generating 64 initial concepts through
        brainstorming and morph charts.
    </p>

    <p>
        These concepts were systematically narrowed to three viable alternatives
        using feasibility checks, multi-voting, graphical decision charts, and a
        Pugh matrix to select a final conceptual design.
    </p>

    <div class="section-title">Outcome</div>
    <p>
        The final conceptual design meets sustainability, accessibility, and
        operational objectives outlined by the client. The complete design
        documentation received a 96% evaluation and is currently under
        consideration for future implementation by the university.
